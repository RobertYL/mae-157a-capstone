# MECH&AE 157A (Aerospace Design Laboratory) MAV Capstone

Micro air vehicle (MAV) software and final report. Aerospace engineering senior capstone project at UCLA.

### Competition Description

The primary competition is a MAV race, where each vehicle must fly through a <u>set</u> of waypoints as quickly as possible. Each team is scored across multiple criteria (10 point scale):
1. Course lap time
2. Condition of vehicle after the race
3. Craftsmanship & creativity
4. Accuracy of lap time & hover time predictions

### Requirements

- Vehicle speed shall be capped at 1 m/s
  - Teams have the <u>freedom to sequence waypoints</u> known *a priori*.
- Vehicle payload (LiDAR, flight computer, etc.), motors, and propellers shall be standardized between teams.
  - Teams will design the MAV frame and assemble the components freely.

### Folder Structure

All simulations are located in the `sim` folder.

All guidance methods for waypoint sequencing are located in the `guide` folder.

All content for the report is located in the `report` folder.
